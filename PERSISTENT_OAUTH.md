# Persistent OAuth Setup Guide

## **How It Works Now**

The app now works with **persistent authentication** - once a user authenticates, they stay logged in until the server restarts.

### **üîß Backend Changes**

1. **Persistent Token Storage**: Tokens are stored in memory and persist during the session
2. **Automatic Drive Initialization**: Server tries to initialize Drive with stored tokens on startup
3. **Simplified Upload Flow**: No need to check authentication status for each upload
4. **Single User Model**: Designed for one user to authenticate once and use the app

### **üé® Frontend Changes**

1. **Removed Authentication UI**: No more authentication buttons or checks
2. **Direct Upload**: Users can directly select files and upload
3. **Simplified Interface**: Clean, straightforward upload experience

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Start Backend**
```bash
cd backend
node server.js
```

You should see:
```
‚úÖ Backend running on http://localhost:5000
‚úÖ OAuth credentials loaded successfully
‚úÖ Client ID: 247738825910-pu2gtlh6b5un1ln1lpsqv7hb6o3mieei...
‚ÑπÔ∏è  No stored tokens found. User needs to authenticate at /auth/google
```

### **Step 2: First-Time Authentication**
1. **Open browser** and go to: `http://localhost:5000/auth/google`
2. **Sign in** with your Google account
3. **Grant permissions** to the app
4. **You'll see**: "Authentication successful! You can now upload files."

### **Step 3: Start Frontend**
```bash
cd gdrive-hakeem
npm start
```

### **Step 4: Use the App**
- Go to `http://localhost:3000`
- Select any file
- Click "Upload File"
- File will be uploaded to your Google Drive in "GDrive Uploads" folder

## **How It Works**

1. **First Time**: User authenticates via `/auth/google`
2. **Tokens Stored**: OAuth tokens are stored in server memory
3. **Persistent Session**: Tokens remain valid until server restarts
4. **Direct Uploads**: All uploads go to the authenticated user's Drive
5. **Automatic Folder**: Creates "GDrive Uploads" folder automatically

## **Benefits**

- ‚úÖ **One-time authentication** - no need to sign in repeatedly
- ‚úÖ **Simple user experience** - just select and upload
- ‚úÖ **Persistent session** - works until server restart
- ‚úÖ **Automatic folder creation** - no manual setup needed
- ‚úÖ **No storage quota issues** - uses personal Google Drive

## **Important Notes**

- **Server Restart**: If you restart the backend server, you'll need to authenticate again
- **Single User**: This setup is designed for one user per server instance
- **Production**: For production, implement proper token storage (database)
- **Security**: Tokens are stored in memory only (not persistent across restarts)

## **Troubleshooting**

### **"Google Drive not authenticated" Error**
- Go to `http://localhost:5000/auth/google` to authenticate
- Make sure you complete the OAuth flow

### **Upload Fails**
- Check if the backend server is running
- Verify you've authenticated at least once
- Check console logs for detailed error messages

Your persistent OAuth setup is now complete!
